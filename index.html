      <h3>Developer - Hacker - Explorer</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Sighfy, a university student studying for a B.S. degree in Cyber Security.
          <br><br> Ever since I was young I knew that I wanted to work in technology. I never thought that I would be able to work and study in becoming a hacker, and yet here I am. Reasearching, testing, and learning have all been the foundation of my passion. Without that, and a bit of stubborness, I probably wouldn't still be doing what I love and expanidng my skills.
          <br> When I decided that I wanted to increase my knowledge in python, database, and server management, I decided to learn the discord.py library and make myself an app. Thoughout 2022, this has been primarily a side project where I'll work on it when studies are finished for the day. Now a year later I can proudly say that I can make custom Discord Bots.
          <br><br>Disclaimer, I decided to make this website one night after buying myself the domain. oops..
          <br>Enjoy it while it's up before it get's replaced!
          <br><br>The background image was taken by me on a relaxing summer night in Southern California.
