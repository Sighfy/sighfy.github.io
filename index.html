      <h1>Sighfy</h1>
      <h3>Developer - Hacker</h3>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Sighfy, and I'm a university student currently pursuing a B.S. degree in Cyber Security. <!-- I'm also a hobby bot developer for Discord. -->
          <br><br>Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by technology and its endless possibilities. As I pursued my studies in Cyber Security, my interest in the field has only grown stronger. In my free time, I enjoy researching, testing, and learning new techniques related to <!-- secure programming practices, networking, operating system security, and other areas of --> Cyber Security. My passion for the field drives me to constantly improve my skills and knowledge.
          <br><br>I'm proud to serve as an assistant in teaching database design to fellow students, sharing my knowledge and expertise to help others succeed is something I find immensely rewarding. My hobby of creating Discord bots has led me to gain a lot of knowledge and expertise in this area. It's been a challenging yet rewarding experience, and well worth it. <!-- Whether you're looking for a simple bot to automate tasks or something more complex to enhance your server's functionality, I'm confident that I can help you bring your vision to life. -->
          <br><br>My primary focus right now is on my studies and research. That said, I'm always happy to discuss my bot development services. If you're interested in learning more about my work or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me using the links below. Thanks for visiting - I hope you enjoy your stay!
          <br><br>Disclaimer: I created this website on a whim after purchasing my domain, so please forgive any rough edges. And as always, thanks for your interest in my work.
